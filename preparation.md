# Getting Started

## 1. Create a GitHub account
- Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one. 
- After registering, sign in to your account.

## 2a. Install GitHub Desktop (for Windows or Mac users)
- If you are using a **Windows** or **Mac** computer, download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - More guidance can be found in guides from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop).
- Sign into GitHub Desktop using your GitHub credentials
- In ```File > Options > Git```, enter the name and email that you want associated with your work ([More help](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/configuring-git-for-github-desktop)).
- (optional) Once configured, the main GitHub Desktop page will show any repositories that exist in your GitHub account. For those who use GitHub Desktop or git already, you can add any local repositories that already exist on your computer.

## 2b. Install git (for Linux users or adventurous Windows/Mac users)
- **If you are a Linux user**, GitHub Desktop will not work for you. Instead, you'll need to learn how to install and use git and git Bash. 
- Navigate to the [official git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instructions to download and install for your operating system.


When you've finished preparing, navigate to the [Introduction](introduction) section to learn the basics.

## Get the data

You will have an opportunity to download the data during the workshop; however, if you would like to do so ahead of time, it can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/scds/intro-tableau/raw/main/data/humdata_GHGEmissionsGES.xlsx).

## Get the software
This hands-on workshop uses [**Tableau**](https://www.tableau.com/), a software application for data visualization. We ask that you download Tableau in advance of the workshop to be able to participate in it to the fullest extent.

You have three options for downloading Tableau:
1. [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) (limited version)
2. A 14-day trial of [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/trial)
3. A 1-year instructor or student license for [Tableau Desktop for academic purposes](https://www.tableau.com/academic/teaching) 

The three options will be discussed further during the workshop; for now, we recommend Tableau Public or the 14-day trial of Tableau Desktop. Please contact the [Sherman Centre](mailto:scds@mcmaster.ca) if you have any difficulties downloading or opening the software.
